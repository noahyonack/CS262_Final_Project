Testing:
	
	* Have a testing flag which let's you talk to ports instead of IPs
	* Add network test code (when machines fail, what happens!) general failure tests!
	* Debug setup/teardown for testing when all are on the same port

Future Work:

	* Benchmarking availability functions (CPU, memory pressure, queue size, etc.) and efficiency of resending chunks after timeouts
	* Implement reputation scores so that slow machines get deprioritized (as opposed to being excluded entirely from our network)
